# StockSustainability
We are developing a model to analyze the sustainability of S&P 500 stocks. 
We will consider their environmental and social impact as well as their governance structure, controversy, and risk factor.
Using these factors, we give each stock a sustainability score which analysts can use for their internal tools when choosing stocks to buy.
This also can help environmentally-conscious users responsibly invest into companies which align with their interests.
